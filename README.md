#### Project_4_Diabetes

# Context
Diabetes impacts millions of Americans each year and causes a significant financial burden on the economy. Diabetes is a chronic disease in which individuals lose the ability to effectively regulate levels of glucose in the blood, and can lead to reduced quality of life and life expectancy. Insulin from the pancreas helps enable cells within the body to use those sugars in th bloodstream for energy. When an individual has diabetes, the body is either not making enough insulin or is unable to effectively use the insulin.
Although there is no cure for diabetes, strategies like losing weight, eating healthy, being active, and receiving medical treatments can mitigate the harms of the disease. 

# Data 
For this project, We used a dataset from *Kaggle.com*. The dataset is on Diabetes Health indicators. 
The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System(BRFSS) is a health-related telephone survey that is collected annually by the *CDC*. The survey collects responses from over 400,000 Americans on health-related risk behaviors,chronic health conditions, and the use of preventative services. 
The data package coame with 3 files. For this project, the csv file with the diabetes 50-50 split health indicators provided the best option to accurately predict if an individual has diabetes.
